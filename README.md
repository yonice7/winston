### Set a virtual environment for macos

If you're using macos it's strongly recommended to set a virtual environment so you can still the modules using pip

```shell
# for practicity have this alias for python and pip in your .zshrc
alias python=python3
alias pip=pip3

# go to the dir ~/.local since all your config files should go there
cd ~/.local
# create the venv
python -m venv venv
# go to the venv dir
cd venv
# active the venv
source bin/activate
# deactive the venv
deactive
```

Once the environment is already activated go to the repository folder `cd /path/to/winston` and install the required modules

# in ~/path/to/winston/ repository run
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
